# Vision Assistant – Android Application

Vision Assistant is an Android-based mobile application designed to assist users by performing real-time object detection using the device camera. The application leverages on-device machine learning to identify objects in the surrounding environment, making it useful for vision assistance and educational purposes.

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate engineering project and focuses on applying computer vision concepts in a practical mobile application.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using the mobile camera
- On-device machine learning (no internet required)
- Fast and privacy-friendly processing
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technologies Used

- Android (Kotlin)
- Android Studio
- TensorFlow Lite
- Camera API
- Machine Learning (Object Detection)

## How It Works

1. The application accesses the device camera.
2. Live camera frames are processed using a TensorFlow Lite model.
3. Detected objects are identified based on predefined labels.
4. Results are displayed in real-time on the screen.
